# Cosine-Function-Table-Generator-C-Programming-Project-
This program, written in C, computes and prints a table of values for the mathematical function:  𝑓 ( 𝑥 ) = cos ⁡ ( 𝑥 ) f(x)=cos(x)


## 📌 Overview

This program, written in **C**, computes and prints a table of values for the mathematical function:


f(x) = cos(x)


over a user-defined range with a specified step size.

It demonstrates core **C programming fundamentals** such as function creation, user input handling, loops, and use of standard libraries (`stdio.h`, `math.h`).

## 🛠️ Features

* Prompts the user to input:

  * Lower bound (`lo`)
  * Upper bound (`hi`)
  * Step size (`step`)
* Iterates over the range `[lo, hi]` with the given step size.
* Computes `f(x) = cos(x)` for each value of `x`.
* Prints the results in a clean, formatted table.


## 🧠 Lessons Learned

* How to structure and call functions in C.
* Handling floating-point input/output with `scanf` and `printf`.
* Using the `math.h` library for trigonometric functions.
* Implementing loops with floating-point increments.


Do you also want me to **make a nicer table-format output** (instead of raw `printf`) so when recruiters see the run example, it looks more professional?
